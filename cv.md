## **About me**
I'm 22 years old and I work as an economist in public medical institution. After working there for almost one year I've realized I waste time, potential, strength doing things I don't like. 
 I want to develop and learn someting new, but my job limits me, I have a certain range of duties, which I perform day-to-day. It's monotonous and boring. 

 Becauce I'm such a person, who likes to learn something new, I'v decided to change a sphere of activity. And my first step on this way is courses in RS-School.
