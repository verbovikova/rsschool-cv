## **About me**
I'm 22 years old and i work as an economist in public medical institution. After working there for almost one year I've realized I waste time, potential, strength doing thing I don't like. 
I want to develop and learn somting new, but my job limits me, I have a certain range of duties, which I perform day-to-day. I can say that this work is monotonous and boring. 

Becauce I'm such a person, who likes to learn somthing new, I decide to change sphere of activity. And my first step on this way is courses in RS-School.
